TODO:
 * reimplement the config.py / .config mechanism.  i'd like for many commands
   to share very similar argument or argument sets, as well as have some
   common config options.  I'm not sure the best way to do this.

 * Find a better location to place and pull the PKL files currently in the pdb
   directory.  Ultimately, these should be stored in a real DB.  Until then,
   they should sit in a location that is accessible from the www scripts,
   backend scripts, and user utilities.

 * clean up plc.py; there's a lot of redundent code.

Lower priority:
 * Add a more structured, 'automate' library of scripts and means of making
   batch calls, etc.

 * add a third package for user tools that will interact with the Monitor
   service.  Mostly, I'm guessing this would be queries for the live status of
   nodes and a more reliable 'reboot' and 'reinstall' mechanism than currently
   availble with PLC.

Done:
 * pull out global configuration information from various files, like rt_db,
   mailer.py,  auth.py, and any others.  Create a single configuration file
   from which all others pull.

   - convert plc and other files to use the new monitorconfig.py rather than
     auth, or plc.*
   - need to alter all import 'auth' statements.
